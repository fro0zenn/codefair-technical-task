# Main description:
I want you to take into account the speed at which I completed this task. I opened your email at around 17:00.

Also, please note that I haven't worked on technical tasks for about three months. I haven't been coding at all during this time, so I had to recall many things. Considering that it's the weekend now, I wouldn't like to spend it all just to deliver a super perfect test assignment. Please keep in mind that I'm doing this for free.

I'd like to mention that I could have completed it faster, but I encountered an issue with parsing, more precisely with its library. That's why I quickly created my own parser with the help of AI. In the video link, I didn't see any parsing of YouTube videos, only images. I kept the content quite simple, and in terms of layout, I implemented basic elements. I don't believe that design plays such a crucial role in this technical task. I have created many websites, and some of them are in my CV.

If you see No Data! - probably you should open this link https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://www.eurogamer.net/feed/videos and activate working cors.

Thanks!
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
